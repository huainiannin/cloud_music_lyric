Yesterday Once More
 作曲 : Richard Carpenter and John Bettis
 作词 : Richard Carpenter and John Bettis
when i was young i'd listen to the radio
waiting for my favorite songs
when they played i'd sing along,
it make me smile.
those were such happy times and not so long ago
how i wondered where they'd gone.
but they're back again just like a long lost friend
all the songs i love so well.
every shalala every wo'wo
still shines.
every shing-a-ling-a-ling
that they're starting
to sing so fine
when they get to the part
where he's breaking her heart
it can really make me cry
just like before.
it's yesterday once more.
(shoobie do lang lang)
looking back on how it was in years gone by
and the good times that had
makes today seem rather sad,
so much has changed.
it was songs of love that i would sing to them
and i'd memorise each word.
those old melodies still sound so good to me
as they melt the years away
every shalala every wo'wo still shines
every shing-a-ling-a-ling
that they're startingto sing
so fine
all my best memorise come back clearly to me
some can even make me cry
just like before.
it's yesterday once more.
(shoobie do lang lang)
every shalala every wo'wo still shines.
every shing-a-ling-a-ling
that they're starting to sing
so fine
every shalala every wo'wo still shines.

Yesterday Once More

当我年轻时 我喜欢听收音机
等待我最喜爱的歌
当他们演奏时我会跟着唱
这会让我微微笑
那些都是多么快乐的时光啊 感觉就在不久之前呢
我是多么想知道它们去了哪儿
但是它们又回来了 像一位久未谋面的朋友
那些歌我依旧喜欢
每一声 Shalala 每一声Wo-o-wo-o
仍然闪亮
每一声 Shing-a-ling-a-ling
当他们开始唱时
如此欢畅
当唱到
他让她伤心的那一段时
我真的会哭
一如往昔
这是昨日的重现
(shoobie do lang lang)
回首过去的几年
我曾有过的欢乐时光
今天似乎更加悲伤
一切都变了
这就是那些跟着唱过的旧情歌
我记住的每个字眼
那些古老旋律 我仍然觉得那么动听
可以把岁月融化
每一声Sha-la-la-la每一声Wo-o-wo-o 仍然闪亮
每一声 shing-a-ling-a-ling
当他们开始唱时
如此欢畅
我所有的美好回忆 清晰地浮现
我真的会哭
一如往昔
这是昨日的重现
(shoobie do lang lang)
每一声Sha-la-la-la每一声Wo-o-wo-o 仍然闪亮
每一声 shing-a-ling-a-ling
当他们开始
如此欢畅
每一声Sha-la-la-la每一声Wo-o-wo-o 仍然闪亮

Long ago and oh so far away
I fell in love with you before the second show
Your guitar' it sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby' baby' baby' baby' oh' baby'
I love you I really do

Loneliness is a such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait to be with you again
What to say to make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar

The End


Superstar


很久以前 噢 距今如此遥远
我爱上了你 在看了你第一场演出之后
你的吉他 弹得如此甜美而纯澈
但你人并不在此
那只是收音机在放
你不记得你告诉我你爱我的吗 宝贝
你说你会以这种方式闪亮回归 宝贝
宝贝 宝贝 宝贝 宝贝 噢 宝贝
我爱你 我确实爱你
孤独是一种如此悲伤的东西
我几乎再也等不到和你在一起了
我该说什么让你再次闪亮回归呢
再次回到我身边
弹奏你悲伤的吉他
你不记得你告诉我你爱我的吗 宝贝
你说你会以这种方式闪亮回归 宝贝
宝贝 宝贝 宝贝 宝贝 噢 宝贝
我爱你 我确实爱你
你不记得你告诉我你爱我的吗 宝贝
你说你会以这种方式闪亮回归 宝贝

Rainy Days And Mondays
 作曲 : Paul Williams/Roger Nichols
 作词 : Paul Williams/Roger Nichols
Talkin' to myself and feelin' old
Sometimes I'd like to quit
Nothing ever seems to fit
Hangin' around
Nothing to do but frown
Rainy Days and Mondays always get me down.
What I've got they used to call the blues
Nothin' is really wrong
Feelin' like I don't belong
Walkin' around
Some kind of lonely clown
Rainy Days and Mondays always get me down.
Funny but it seems I always wind up here with you
Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me.
What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out
We know what it's all about
Hangin' around
Nothing to do but frown
Rainy Days and Mondays always get me down.
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me.
What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out
We know what it's all about
Hangin' around
Nothing to do but frown
Rainy Days and Mondays always get me down.
Hangin' around
Nothing to do but frown
Rainy Days and Mondays always get me down.

Rainy Days And Mondays
我对自己说我已老，
有时我想放弃
没有什么似乎合适
四处闲逛
除了面露不悦外无事可做
雨天和周一总让我沮丧。
这种情绪 人们曾叫它忧郁
没有什么真的出了问题
只是我无所适从。
四处闲逛
像孤独的小丑一样
雨天和周一总让我沮丧。
滑稽 但似乎我经常在此处与你闲逛
我很高兴知道有人爱我
滑稽但似乎是我唯一能做的事
去找一位钟爱我的人
这种感觉曾经出现过，却又消失
再说已无益
我们了解这大概是什么
四处闲逛
除了面露不悦外无事可做
雨天和周一总让我沮丧。

Top Of The World
Such a feelin's comin' over me
There is wonder in most everthing I see
Not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes
and I won't be surprised if it's a dream
Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
and the reason is clear
It's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
and the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Every since you've been around your love
Put me at the top of the world
Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me
There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
and the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Every since you've been around your love
Put me at the top of the world
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
and the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Every since you've been around your love
Put me at the top of the world

Top Of The World
这样的感觉迎面而来
所有我见过的东西都是奇蹟
天空万里情而我眼中闪耀着光芒
即使是梦我也不会惊讶
我所想要这世界的一切
现在对我来说特别的真实
原因好简单
因為你在这裡
你是我所见过最接近天堂的东西
我在这个世界的最高点望着万物
我可找到的唯一解释
是你来了之后
带给我的爱 你的爱
我在这个世界的最高点望着万物
风儿得知我的名字
告诉我今后事情将有所改变
树上的绿叶、微风的触摸
让我充满了幸福的愉快感觉
在我心中只有一个希望
今日结束之后希望我能发现
明天对你和我都是一样
只要有你在此，我就能心想事成~
我在这个世界的最高点望着万物
我可找到的唯一解释
是你来了之后
带给我的爱 你的爱
把我放在这个世界的最高点
我在这个世界的最高点望着万物
我可找到的唯一解释
是你来了之后
带给我的爱 你的爱
把我放在这个世界的最高点
Ticket To Ride
I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The boy that's driving me mad
is going away
He's got a ticket to ride
and he don't care...
He said that living with me
was bringing him down yeah
He would never be free
when I was around
I don't know why he's ridin' so high
He ought to ride
he ought to ride by me
before he gets to saying goodbye
he ought to ride by me.
I think it's today yeah
is going away, ahh...
and he don't care,don't care away.
I think I'm gonna be sad...

Ticket To Ride

我想我会为此难过
大概是今天吧
那个让我抓狂的男孩
要走了
他去意已决
他去意已决
他去意已决
他漠不关心
说跟我在一起
让他消沉
当我在身边的时候
他得不到想要的自由
他去意已决
他去意已决
他去意已决
他漠不关心
我并不清楚他为何如此急于离去
但他应该离去
离我而去
而不要说再见
他应该离去
离我而去
我认为我会为此悲伤
就是今天吧
那个让我抓狂的男孩
要离开了
他去意已决
他去意已决
他去意已决
他并不介意，潇洒离去
我认为我会为此悲伤
我认为我会为此悲伤
我认为我会为此悲伤
我认为我会为此悲伤
我认为我会为此悲伤
我认为我会为此悲伤

Love Is Surrender
Talk about love
How it makes life complete
You can talk all you want
Make it sound good and sweet
But the words have an empty ring
And they don't really mean a thing
Without love you are not to be found
You are not to be found
For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you dare
music
Shout about love
Then the wars will all end
You can shout "we're all brothers",
And eve pretend
But you can't cover up the past
Just pretending will never last
Without love you are nothing at all
You are nothing at all
For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you dare
For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you dare


Love Is Surrender

关于爱
如何让生命完整
你尽可畅所欲言
听起来甜蜜又美好
但那只是些空话
并不意味着什么
心中无爱，你不会被注意
你不会被注意
因为爱情就是屈服
如果你介意就要向它屈服
如果你介意就要向它屈服
dala~~~
打着爱的幌子
所有的战争都会即刻消弭
你可以高呼“我们是兄弟”
甚至只是假装如此
但你无法掩盖过去
谎言终究会被揭穿
心中无爱，你什么都不是
什么都不是
因为爱就是屈服
如果你介意就要向它屈服
如果你介意就要向它屈服
因为爱就是屈服
如果你介意就要向它屈服
如果你介意就要向它屈服

Maybe It's You
 作曲 : Richard Carpenter & John Bettis
 作词 : Bettis, Carpenter
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me
Maybe it's just
the constant rhythm of the sea
Maybe it's just
that I've never been the kind
Who can pass a lucky penny by

Maybe it's wise, maybe it's not
Maybe it's you
who brought me caring I forgot
Isn't it nice
to talk about the special way
That you smile whenever I'm around

Rising on the shore the ocean came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
His only thought was love for me

Couldn't we stay, or must you go
Couldn't we stay
and watch the splashing rocks we throw
Only a fool
would want to leave the paradise
That I find whenever you're around
Only a fool

Isn't it nice
to talk about the special way
That you smile whenever I'm around

Rising on the shore the ocean came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
His only thought was love for me

love for me

Couldn't we stay, or must you go
Couldn't we stay
and watch the splashing rocks we throw
Only a fool
would want to leave the paradise
That I find whenever you're around
Only a fool
Only a fool


Maybe It's You



也许是你 也许是我
也许只是
大海奔腾不息的节奏
也许只是这样吧
我从来不是那种
幸运的人儿
无论聪明与否
也许是你
关心着我 而我忘却了你的关怀
这不好吗
谈谈我在你身边时
你动人微笑的样子
潮波涌上岸头
踏着波浪 柔软如绒
他全心全意的爱我
我们不能留下来吗 还是你必须离开呢
我们不能留下来吗
看我们打水漂的石子发呆
只有傻瓜
才想离开幸福的天堂
有你相随 幸福常在
只有傻瓜
这不好吗
谈谈我在你身边时
你动人微笑的样子
潮波涌上岸头
踏着波浪 柔软如绒
他全心全意的爱我
爱着我
我们不能留下来吗 还是你必须离开呢
我们不能留下来吗
看我们打水漂的石子发呆
只有傻瓜
才想离开幸福的天堂
有你相随 幸福常在
只有傻瓜
只有傻瓜

Reason To Believe
Reason to Believe
Carpenters

If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
never think about myself
If you take the time to change my mind
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind


Reason To Believe

相信的理由
卡朋特
如果我仔细倾听你对我说的话
我会找到方法去相信这一切都是真的
尽管知道在我哭泣的时候你还在说谎
我仍然努力去寻找相信你的理由
你让我如此难以独自生活
你让我如此轻易的去给予
却从不曾为自己考虑
如果你花些时间来改变我的想法
我会找到忘掉过去的方法
尽管知道在我哭泣的时候你还是在说谎
我仍然努力去寻找相信你的理由
你让我如此难以独自生活
你让我如此轻易的去给予
却从不曾为自己考虑
如果我仔细倾听你对我说的话
我会找到方法去相信这一切都是真的
尽管知道在我哭泣的时候你还在说谎
我仍然努力去寻找相信你的理由
你让我如此难以独自生活
你让我如此轻易的去给予
却从不曾为自己考虑

Where Do I Go From Here?
 作曲 : Parker McGee
 作词 : MCGEE, PARKER
Autumn days lying on a bed of leaves
Watching clouds up through the trees
You said our love was more than time
But it's colder now
The trees are bare and the nights are long
Can't get warm since you've been gone
I can't stop singing sad songs

Where do I go from here
Tell me where do I go from here
You said you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from here

Lover's plans like fallen leaves on windy days
Flutter past and they fly away
I thought I knew you oh so well
And I need you now
I need to feel you in the night
I need your smile so warm and bright
I wish my mind could let you go

Where do I go from here
Tell me where do I go from here
You said you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from here

Where do I go from here
Tell me where do I go from here
You said you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from here
You said that you'd take me through the years
So where do I go from here

Where Do I Go From Here?

秋天躺在满是落叶的床上
看着云朵在树丛中穿梭
你说时间无法冲淡我们的爱情
现在天气转冷了
叶落树荒，秋夜漫长
你走后便不曾感到温暖
我无法自抑的哼唱悲伤的曲调
我该何去何从呢？
你说我该何去何从啊！
你曾说过你会陪我一直走下去
那我该何去何从？
恋人的打算就像寒风掠过的日子里飘荡的落叶
摇摇欲坠，随风飘散
我曾以为我是如此的了解你
但我现在需要你啊
我需要在夜晚感受你的温暖
我需要你的微笑带给我温暖和光明
我希望我可以忘记你
我该何去何从呢？
告诉我我该何去何从啊？
你曾说过你会陪我一直走下去
那我该何去何从呢？
我该何去何从啊？
告诉我我该何去何从啊？
你曾说过你会陪我一直走下去
那我该何去何从呢？
你曾说过你会陪我一直走下去
那我该何去何从啊？

This Masquerade
Carpenters

Are we really happy with this lonely game we play,
Looking for the right words to say?
Searching but not finding  understanding anyway,
We're lost in this masquerade.
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start.
We try to talk it over, but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play.
Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes,
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in this masquerade.

We try to talk it over, but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play.
Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes,
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in this masquerade.
We're lost in a masquerade.

And we're lost in a masquerade.


This Masquerade

化装舞会
Carpenters
在这个孤独的游戏中 我们真的快乐吗
寻找着合适的话语去诉说
寻找着 却未发现
我们迷失在了这场化妆舞会中
我们都害怕承认 彼此已经相隔太远
一开始就彼此封闭
试图交谈 但却欲言又止
我们已经迷失在这个孤独的游戏当中
当我每次看着你眼睛的时候 离开的想法就会转瞬即逝
无论我多么努力
想要知道为什么我们会走到今天的境地
我们迷失在了这场化妆舞会中
试图交谈 但却欲言又止
我们已经迷失在这个孤独的游戏当中
当我每次看着你眼睛的时候 离开的想法就会转瞬即逝
无论我多么努力
想要知道为什么我们会走到今天的境地
我们迷失在了这场化妆舞会中
我们迷失在一场化妆舞会中
我们迷失在一场化妆舞会中

It's Going To Take Some Time
 作曲 : Carole King & Toni Stern
It's going to take some time this time
To get myself in shape
I really fell outta line this time
I really missed the gate
The birds on the telephone line (this time)
Are crying out to me (this time)
And I won't be so blind next time
And I'll find some harmony

And it's going to take some time this time
And that keep me demays
And like the young trees in the winter time
I'll learn how to bend
After all the tears we've spend
How could we make amends
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again
And it's going to take some time,
This time
And that keep me demays
I'll learn how to bend

And it's going to take some time this time
No matter what I plan
And like the young trees in the winter time
I'll learn how to bend
After all the tears we've spend
How could we make amends
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again...
And it's going to take some time
This time


One More Time
I'm going way down south to Louisiana  tonight
Well  I'll just close my eyes.And everything's alright
And though I'm really far away
I'll make my get away
And no one need really
Know that I've been gone
One more time for the good times
That far out weigh the bad
One more time for the good times
When love was all we had
I'm going way down south to Baton Rouge
Well  I'll just close the door
And turn out all the lights
And all the images dance by
Of folks and friends who lie
Back home where things are slow
And easy going
One more time for the good times
That far out weigh the bad
One more time for the good times
When love was all
When love was all
When love was all we had
One more time

One More Time

今晚我要往南去向路易斯安那州
我闭上自己的眼睛,一切都很好
虽然我真的离得很远
我将使自己尽可能远离
没有人真的需要
知道我已经离去
再一次为了这美好时光
远离要考虑的坏事情
再一次为了这美好时光
当爱是我们所拥有的全部
我要往南去向巴吞鲁日
我将会在靠在门旁
关了所有的灯光
以及那些撒谎的人和朋友
跳舞的影像
回到家事情变得缓慢
而随和
再一次为了这美好时光
不去考虑权衡那些烦心事
再一次 为了这美好时光
当爱是所有
当爱是所有
当爱是我们所拥有的全部
再一次...

Those Good Old Dreams
 作曲 : Richard Carpenter & John Bettis
As a child I was known for makes-believing
All alone I created fantasies
As I grew people called it self deceiving
But my heart helped me hold the memories
As I walk through the world I find around me
Something new yet familiar's in the air
I feel it everywhere
Like a child's eyes on a Christmas night
I'm looking at you now finding answers to my prayers
It's a new day for those good old dreams
One by one it seems they're coming true
Here's the morning that my heart had seen
Here's the morning that just had to come through
Not finished...

Those Good Old Dreams

我小时候是出了名地爱幻想
孤零零的我遐想万千
随着我慢慢长大 人们说这是自我欺骗
但我心里留存这这些记忆
当我走进我生活的这个世界
有些熟悉而陌生的感觉弥漫在空气中
我觉得它无处不在
犹如孩童圣诞夜的明眸
我凝视着你 想要寻找我祈祷的回应
对那些美好旧梦来说这是全新的一天
它们会一一成真
这个清晨 我敞开心扉
这个清晨  一切都会安然度过
对那些美好旧梦来说这是全新的一天
未完待续
对那些美好旧梦来说这是全新的一天
它们会一一成真
这个清晨 我敞开心扉
这个清晨  一切都会安然度过
未完待续

For All We Know
Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
So much to say
And as we go
From day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
"I knew you well"
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow
For all we know.

For All We Know

亲爱的，看看我们俩
很多地方都不一样
要用一辈子去分享
去倾诉
随着岁月
日复一日消逝
我可以感觉你离我越来越近
但是唯有时间能证明
让我们用一辈子去诉说
“我很了解你”
因为只有时间能证明
爱会滋长
因为我们都知道
亲爱的，看看我们俩
很多地方都不一样
让我们用一辈子去诉说
“我很了解你”

Crystal Lullaby
Listen to the song he sings
Can’t you see his music brings her crystal sleep?
As her heavy eyelids fall
He’s taking her to where the dolls rule the world
And in that land of make believe
Is where he'll leave her sleeping
Softly warm in a crystal lullaby
He’s weaving her a paper castle
Where dancing clowns with tassels made of fur
Welcome her into their world
That lives inside the dreams of every little girl
She’s guarded by a brave tin soldier
Sitting on her shoulder
Taken there in a crystal lullaby
Sometimes when 
I listen to
The velvet song that fills the summer afternoon
Something deep within me sighs
And wishes for the peaceful skies of long ago
That wrapped my cares in silver air
And carried them away leaving me
And a crystal lullaby
That wrapped my cares in silver air
And carried them away leaving me
And a crystal lullaby

I Believe You


I  believe  you
When  you  say  that  you  will  reach  into  the  sky
And  steal  a  star  so  you  can  put  it  on  my  finger
I  believe  you
Baby,I  believe  you
I  believe  you
When  you  say  that  every  time  that  we  make  love
Will  be  the  first  time  we ’ve  made  love
And  every  act  of  love  will  please  you
Baby,I  believe  you
Blind  faith  makes  me  follow  you
I ’d  live  in  a  cave  if  you  wanted  to
Just  ask  me  and  I ’ll  marry  you
You  don ’t  have  to  sell  me
‘Cause  you  overwhelm  me
I ’ve  made  up  my  mind  for  a  life  time
I  believe  you
When  you  swear  your  love  will  keep  on  growin ’strong
And  that  forever  isn ’t  long  enough  to  love  me  like  you  need  to
Baby,I  believe  you
Baby,I  believe  you
Honey,I  love  you
Blind  faith  makes  me  follow  you
I ’d  live  in  a  cave  if  you  wanted  to
Just  ask  me  and  I ’ll  marry  you
You  don ’t  have  to  sell  me
‘Cause  you  overwhelm  me
I ’ve  made  up  my  mind  for  a  life  time
I  believe  you
I  believe  you
When  you  swear  your  love  will  keep  on  growin ’strong
And  that  forever  isn ’t  long  enough  to  love  me  like  you  need  to
When  you  say  you ’ll  fill  my  body  with  your  soul
Baby,I  believe  you
Baby,I  believe  you
Honey,I  love  you
And  love  will  grow  into  a  freckled  little  girl
Who  looks  like  we  do
Baby,I  believe  you
Baby,I  believe  you

(They Long To Be) Close To You
Carpenters

Why do birds suddenly appear
Everytime you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why stars fall down from the sky
Everytime you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
They decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And put a starlight in your eyes so blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you, all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
They decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And put a starlight in your eyes so blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you, all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Close to you...
Close to you...
Close to you...


(They Long To Be) Close To You



为什么每当你靠近时
鸟儿就突然出现了
就好似我一样，它们也渴望着
靠近你
为什么每当你走进时
星辰就从夜空坠落了
就好似我一样
靠近你
你降临到这世上的那天
天使们齐聚一堂
想创造一个能够成真的梦想
所以她们把月亮的光芒 洒于你金黄的发丝
把星光洒于你湛蓝的双眸
这就是为什么女孩儿们都喜欢
缠着你
就像我一样，她们也渴望着
靠近你
你降临到这世上的那天
天使们齐聚一堂
想创造一个能够成真的梦想
所以她们把月亮的光芒 洒于你金黄的发丝
把星光洒于你湛蓝的双眸
这就是为什么女孩儿们都喜欢
缠着你
就像我一样，她们也渴望着
靠近你
就像我一样，她们也渴望着
靠近你
靠近你
靠近你
靠近你

Bless The Beasts And Children
 作曲 : Barry DeVorzon & Perry Botkin Jr.
 作词 : BOTKIN/DEVORZON
Bless the beasts and the children
For in this world they have no voice
They have no choice
Bless the beasts and the children
For the world can never be
The world they see
Light their way
When the darkness surrounds them
Give them love
Let it shine all around them
Bless the beasts and the children
Give them shelter from a storm
Keep them safe
Keep them warm
Light their way
When the darkness surrounds them
Give them love
Let it shine all around them
Bless the beasts and the children
Give them shelter from a storm
Keep them safe
Keep them warm

All You Get From Love Is A Love Song
 作曲 : Steve Eaton
Like sailin' on a sailin' ship to nowhere,
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze.
As season fly I knew that I was losing
Love was washed away with the driftin tide.
Oh it's a dirty old shame that all you get from love is a love song
It's gotcha layin up nights waiting for the music to start.
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love song.
Because the best love song is writing with a broken heart.
Now the tears in my eyes are ever blindin'
The future that lies before me I cannot see
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising
Lightin' up the world for everyone, but not for me.
Oh it's a dirty old shame that all you get from love is a love song
It's gotcha layin up nights waiting for the music to start.
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love song.
Because the best love song is writing with a broken heart.
Oh it's a dirty old shame that all you get from love is a love song
It's gotcha layin up nights waiting for the music to start.
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to take the blame for a love song.
Because the best love song is writing with a broken heart.
Oh it's a dirty old shame that all you get from love is a love song
It's gotcha layin up nights waiting for the music to start.


All You Get From Love Is A Love Song

如同行驶一艘无帆之船
海风般的爱将我的心掌舵
四季变幻，我知道我在迷失
爱情随着漂流的潮汐一起被冲走了
哦，这古旧的耻辱 你从爱情中所得之物仅是一首情歌
静候夜晚的音乐奏响
这真是古老而肮脏的羞耻 当你要为一首情歌而倍感痛苦
因为最好的情歌是以破碎的心写成
现在眼中泪水让我视线模糊
在我面前的未来也无法看见
尽管我知道明天太阳依旧升起
照亮所有人的世界却除了我的
你从爱情中所得之物仅是一首情歌
静候夜晚的音乐奏响
这真是古老而肮脏的羞耻 当你要为一首情歌而倍感痛苦
因为最好的情歌是以破碎的心写成
你从爱情中所得之物仅是一首情歌
静候夜晚的音乐奏响
这真是古老而肮脏的羞耻 当你要为一首情歌而倍感痛苦
因为最好的情歌是以破碎的心写成
你从爱情中所得之物仅是一首情歌
静候夜晚的音乐奏响

I Need To Be In Love
 作曲 : Richard Carpenter and John Bettis
 作词 : Richard Carpenter and John Bettis
I need to be in love
Carpenters


The hardest thing I've ever done is keep believing
There's someone in this crazy world for me
The way that people come and go through temporary lives
My chance could come and I might never know
I used to say \"No promises, let's keep it simple\"
But freedom only helps you say goodbye
It took a while for me to learn that nothing comes for free
The price I paid is high enough for me
I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

So here I am with pockets full of good intentions
But none of them will comfort me tonight
I'm wide awake at 4 a.m. without a friend in sight
I'm hanging on a hope but I'm all right
I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find


I Need To Be In Love

作曲 : Richard Carpenter and John Bettis
作词 : Richard Carpenter and John Bettis
我要陷入爱河
Carpenters
最困难的事情是坚信
在这个疯狂的世界总有一个人为我而活
人们在这短暂的生活中来来往往
爱的人很可能就这样跟我错身而过
过去常说 不要承诺 简单最好
但是只有再见 才能解脱
我花了很久才懂得 没有可以轻易取得的东西
而我所付出的代价太高
我要陷入爱河
我浪费的时间已经很多
在不完美的世界寻找完美
只有像我这样的愚人才会相信我可以找到
纵使今晚我有满怀希望
但还是无法开怀
我凌晨四点苏醒 身边无人陪伴
一切只能寄托希望 但是我真的不坏
我要陷入爱河
我浪费的时间已经很多
在不完美的世界寻找完美
只有像我这样的愚人才会相信我可以找到
我要陷入爱河
我浪费的时间已经很多
在不完美的世界寻找完美
只有像我这样的愚人才会相信我可以找到

Now


歌手：carpenters
now
now  when  it  rains  I  dont  feel  cold
now  that  I  have  your  hand  to  hold
the  winds  might  blow  through  me  but  I  dont  care
theres  no  harm  in  thunder  if  you  are  there
and  now
now  when  we  touch  my  feelings  fly
now  when  I'm  smiling  I  know  why
you  light  up  my  world  like  the  morning  sun
your  so  deep  within  me  were  almost  one
chorus:
and  now
all  the  fears  that  I  have  start  to  fade
I  was  always  afraid  love  might  forget  me
that  love  might  let  me  down
then  look  who  I  found
winds  might  blow  through  me  but  I  don't  care
there's  no  harm  in  thunder  if  you  are  there
and  now
now  when  I  wake  there's  someone  home
I'll  never  face  the  nights  alone
you  gave  me  the  courage  I  need  to  win
to  open  my  heart  and  to  let  you  in
and  I  really  never  knew  how  until  now
until  now
no  I  really  never  knew  how  until
now

Solitaire
Solitaire
Carpenters

There was a man, a lonely man,
who lost his love through his indifference.
A heart that kept, that went unchecked,
until it died within his silence.
And Solitaire's the only game in town,
and every road that takes him down.
And by himself, it's easy to pretend,
he'll never love again.
And keeping to himself he plays the game,
without her love it always ends the same.
While life goes on around him everywhere,
he's playing Solitaire.
A little hope goes up in smoke,
just how it goes, goes without saying.
who would command the hand he's playing.

Hurting Each Other
No one in the world
Ever had a love as sweet as my love
For nowhere in the wolrd
Could there be a boy as true as you love
All my love
I give gladly to you
All your love
You give gladly to me
Tell me why then
Oh why should it be that
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Hurting each other
Without ever knowing why
Close than the leaves
On a weepin' willow, baby, we are
Closer dear are we
Than the simple letters "A" and "B" are
All my life
I could love only you
All your life
You could love only me
Tell me why than
Oh why should it be that
We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Hurting each other
Without ever knowing why
Can't we stop hurting each other
Gotta stop hurting each other
Making each other cry
Breaking each other's heart
Tearing each other apart

Hurting Each Other

世上没有人
拥有过像我一样甜美的爱
没有地方
会有个男孩像你爱的那么汹涌
我所有的爱
都欣然的给你
你所有的爱
也都欣然的给我
但告诉我为什么
为什么后来会这样
我们开始伤害彼此
我们开始伤害彼此
让彼此哭泣
伤害彼此
没有人知道问题出在哪里
比树叶还近
我们比垂柳的树叶还近
我们那么近
比AB两个字母还要亲近
我的一生
我只爱你
你的一生
你也会爱我
但告诉我为什么
为什么后来会这样
我们开始伤害彼此
我们开始伤害彼此
让彼此哭泣
伤害彼此
没有人知道问题出在哪里
我们不能停止伤害彼此吗
停止伤害彼此
让彼此哭泣
伤害彼此的心
撕碎彼此
我们开始伤害彼此
我们开始伤害彼此
让彼此哭泣
伤害彼此的心
撕碎彼此

I Wont Last A Day Without You
I Won't Last A Day Without You
Carpenters

Day after day I must face a world of strangers
Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
Who will always care, you're always there
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

So many times when the city seems to be without a friendly face
A lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
Touch me and I end up singing
Troubles seem to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near

If all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest, I found the best
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
Won't last a day without you...


Sweet, Sweet Smile
Sweet sweet smile
sang by carpenters

You're always in my heart
From early in the mornin' til it's dark
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day

When I wake up in the mornin'
And I see you there
I always whisper a little prayer
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day

I gotta know that you love me
And that you want me
And that you'll always be there
I've gotta know that you care
And I gotta feel your arms around me
And that you need me
And that you'll always be there
I've gotta know that you care

If my times are bringin' me down
You're the only one that I want around
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day

And if I'll all strung out
You're the only one who can straighten me out
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day

I gotta know that you love me
And that you want me
And that you'll always be there
I've gotta know that you care
And I gotta feel your arms around me
And that you need me
And that you'll always be there
I've gotta know that you care

I gotta know that you love me
And that you want me
And that you'll always be there
I've gotta know that you care
And I gotta feel your arms around me
And that you need me
And that you'll always be there
I've gotta know that you care

You're always in my heart
From early in the mornin' til it's dark
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every

The end

你一直都在我的心里
从清晨到黑夜
我能天天看见你那甜甜的微笑
每当我从清晨醒来
会看见你在我身边
我总会轻声祈祷
我能天天看见你那甜甜的微笑
我早就知道你爱我
你也想要我
你会一直陪着我
我已经感觉到你的关心
躺在你的臂弯 我能感受到
你也需要我
你会一直陪着我
我已经感觉到你的关心
如果我的年华将带我老去
你就是那陪我度过时光的人
我能天天看见你那甜甜的微笑
假如我将挣脱所有的束缚
也只有你能将我安定下来
我能天天看见你那甜甜的微笑
我早就知道你爱我
你也想要我
你会一直陪着我

A Song For You
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
You taught me precious secrets of the truth witholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

A Song For You

一生中去过如此多的地方
已经唱过很多歌 写过很多拙文
我抒发过自己的情怀
面对人山人海的观众
但是现在就我们两个人 我想特别唱这首歌给你一个人听
我知道你对我的期望,我也希望那样去做
我对你有点漠然,但是亲爱的你难道不懂吗
你对我来说意味着一切
亲爱的,请你把我看穿
因为现在就我们两个,这首歌我只为你而唱
你让我领悟到真爱的宝贵之处在于毫无隐瞒
你出现在眼前而我在逃避
但是,现在我感觉好多了 .如果我有点词不达意
那么就倾听我这段包含情意的旋律吧
我对你的爱超越时空
我爱你,你是我一生的挚友
当我生命终结
记住,我们生死不离
我们在一起,我为你歌唱
你让我领悟到真爱的宝贵之处在于毫无隐瞒
你出现在眼前而我在逃避
但是,现在我感觉好多了 .如果我有点词不达意
那么就倾听我这段包含情意的旋律吧
我对你的爱超越时空
我爱你,你是我一生的挚友
当我生命终结
记住,我们生死不离
我们在一起,我为你歌唱
我们在一起,我为你歌唱

Ordinary Fool
Only a fool like fools before me
I always think with my heart
Only a fool, that same old story
Seems I was born for the part
It's a lesson to be learned
And a page 
I should have turned
I shouldn't cry but 
I do, like an ordinary fool
When his ordinary dreams fall through
How many times have 
I mistaken
Good looks and laughs for bad news?
And how many times have 
I mistaken
Good looks and laughs for the blues?
When a road 
I walked before
Ends alone at my front door
I shouldn't cry but 
I do, like an ordinary fool
When his ordinary dreams fall through
When a road 
I walked before
Ends alone at my front door
I shouldn't cry but 
I do, like an ordinary fool
When his ordinary dreams fall through

Goobye To Love
Goodbye To Love
Carpenters

I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it
So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way I guess I've always know
I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for something I could live for
All the years of useless search
Have finally reached an end
 Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend

From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can

What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love

Baby Its You
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself
Cause baby it's you
You should hear what they say about you (cheat cheat)
They say you never never never been true woo oh (woo oh)
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do when it's true
Don't want nobody ooh
Cause baby it's you aaaah woo ooh
Many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself
Cause baby it's you (uh wa sha la la la la la la)
Uuuuuuh

Baby Its You

不是你的微笑打动了我的心
不是你的吻让我心碎
许多，许多的夜晚在流逝
我独自坐在家中为你哭泣
我能怎么做
我无能为力
因为亲爱是，是你啊
你真应该听听他们是怎么评价你的（骗子，骗子）
他们说，他们说你永远永远不会说实话
无所谓他们说了些什么
我明白我还是会爱你的全部
我该怎么做当真相来临的时候
我不想要一个人，一个人
因为亲爱是，是你啊
许多，许多的夜晚在流逝
我独自坐在家中为你哭泣
我能怎么做
我无能为力
因为亲爱的，是你啊
呜呜呜呜

Let Me Be The One
let me be the one
carpenters

Some sleepless night if you should find yourself alone
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one
To set things right
When this whole world’s turned upside down
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one

For love and understanding, to find a quiet place
For silent understanding, a loving touch
Come to me when things go wrong
And there’s no love to light the way
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Need someone to turn to
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Need someone to turn to
Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to


Only Yesterday
Only Yesterday
Carpenters

After long enough of being alone,
Ev'ryone must face their share of loneliness.
In my own time nobody knew
the pain I was goin' thru,
And watin' was all my heart could do.
Hope was all I had until you came,
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me.
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light.
Filling the world surrounding me
When I hold you Baby, Baby
Feels like maybe things will be all right
Baby, Baby
Your love's made me
Free as a song singin' forever
Only yesterday when I was sad
And I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only Yesterday

I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us
Share it with me
The best is about to be
So much is left for us to see
When I hold you
Baby, Baby
Feels like maybe things will be all right
Baby, Baby
Your love's made me
Free as a song singin' forever
Only yesterday when I was sad
And I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only Yesterday
Only yesterday when I was sad
And I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave

Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou


Jambalaya

再见乔伊，他要走了，我的天
他要去把小船推到小河
我最美的的伊凡娜，我的天
傻孩子，我们会在小河上度过美好时光
博蒂多，法蒂诺，那个地方很喧闹
十二个亲戚来看伊凡娜
穿着异常隆重的服装，我的天
傻孩子，我们会在小河上度过美好时光
什锦菜和小龙虾派还有鱼片秋葵汤
因为今晚，我要见到我的马歇尔了
带上吉他，装满水果罐，高兴起来
傻孩子，我们会在小河上度过美好时光
要是找个远离都市的地方安顿下来，再给他弄艘独木舟
他会为依凡捕尽河岸所有的鱼
妈妈会去买依凡想要的东西
野孩子，让我们在河岸玩个痛快
有什锦菜,小龙虾派,秋葵加肉片
因为今晚我将见到我的爱人
拿把吉他,装满水果瓮,好不快活
野孩子，让我们在河岸玩个痛快
有什锦菜,小龙虾派,秋葵加肉片
因为今晚我将见到我的爱人
拿把吉他,装满水果瓮,好不快活
野孩子，让我们在河岸玩个痛快
有什锦菜,小龙虾派,秋葵加肉片
因为今晚我将见到我的爱人
拿把吉他,装满水果瓮,好不快活
野孩子，让我们在河岸玩个痛快
有什锦菜,小龙虾派,秋葵加肉片
因为今晚我将见到我的爱人
拿把吉他,装满水果瓮,好不快活
野孩子，让我们在河岸玩个痛快

Touch Me When Were Dancing
Play us a song we can slow dance on
We want to hold each other
Play us a groove so we hardly move
Just let our hearts beat together
Oh baby, cause it feel so good
When were close like this
Whisper is my ear and let me steal a kiss

Come on and touch me
When were dancing
You know youve got that loving touch
(Loving touch)
Touch me when were dancing
I want to feel you when Im falling in love

Tonights the night and it feels so right
My heart is saying it to me
Youre the one Ive waited for so long
So let your love flow through me
Oh baby, cause it feels so good
Just to be this close
Youve got me up so high
I could fly coast to coast


Touch Me When Were Dancing


放首我们可以跳慢舞的歌
我们要紧紧相拥
这一曲之所以让我们难以随之舞动
是因为让我们的心一起跳动
哦宝贝，因为这种感觉太棒了
当这样贴近时
你在耳边柔声呢喃，让我偷吻了你一下
来吧，抚摸我
就在跳舞的时候
你知道你已经得到爱抚
（爱抚）
抚摸我，就在跳舞的时候
我想让你感觉到我正坠入爱河
今晚这一夜，感觉特别棒
我的心悄悄对我说
你就是我等盼已久的唯一
就让你的爱流过我全身
哦宝贝，因为这种感觉太棒了
就是这样贴近
你让我好兴奋
我能飞过五湖四海
来吧，抚摸我
就在跳舞的时候
你知道你已经得到爱抚
（爱抚）
抚摸我，就在跳舞的时候
我想让你感觉到我正坠入爱河
来吧，抚摸我
就在跳舞的时候
你知道你已经得到爱抚
（爱抚）
抚摸我，就在跳舞的时候
我想让你感觉到我正坠入爱河
来吧，抚摸我
就在跳舞的时候
你知道你已经得到爱抚
（爱抚）
抚摸我，就在跳舞的时候
我想让你感觉到我正坠入爱河
Weve Only Just Begun
Weve only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and were on our way
Weve only begun
Before all the rising sun we fly,
So many roads to choose
We start our walking and learn to run.
And yes! Weve just begun.
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
Working together day to day
Together.
And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
Well find a place where theres room to grow
And yes! Weve just begun.

我们才刚刚开始生活
白色的花边和承诺
为幸运而吻，在我们的路上
我们刚刚开始
在太阳升起之前，我们远走高飞
有那么路可以选择
我们开始我们的旅程，学着奔跑
是的！我们刚刚开始。
分享我们的新视野
看着沿路的标志
只有我们两个人谈论它
每天一起走
在一起
当夜幕降临的时候，我们微笑
未来的生活
找到一个有成长空间的地方
是的！我们刚刚开始。

When Its Gone
Where's the word for the sadness
Where's the poetry in the pain
Where's the color in the stain where the tears fallen
It's gone, it's just gone.
Where's the method to this madness
As we create the suffering
And we do each other in and we still hold on
But it's gone, it's just gone
(Bridge)
He says it's gone
And he can't go on living a memory
Mulling it over endlessly
Whey is that so hear for me to see
He says it's gone
And he can't go on trying to live a lie
And when he cries, I know it's over
But I may never know why.
There's no face in the locket
There's no play for the past
I'll put it back in my pocket
It was never meant to last
It's just gone.
(repeat bridge)
He says it's gone
And he can't go on living a memory
Mulling it over endlessly
Whey is that so hear for me to see
He says it's gone
And he can't go on trying to live a lie
And when he cries, I know it's over
But I may never know why.
There's no word for the sadness
There's no poetry in the pain
There's no color in the stain where the tears have fallen
It's gone, it's just gone
It's gone, it's just gone
Well, it's gone.
